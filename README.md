# El-First-Django

NOTE: MORE COMPLETE VERSION HERE - https://gitlab.com/eldon.hayes.eh/El-First-Django

First Django project based on the existing Django tutorial project at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/intro/tutorial01/

As according to the tutorial, this app is a simple poll application with two different aspects to it:
    A public site that lets people view polls and vote in them.
    An admin site that lets you add, change, and delete polls.

Dependencies include Python and Django

Beyond the tutorial, further work done involves utilizing it with Github, addressing security concerns, implementing HTTPS to work with it
(https://timonweb.com/django/https-django-development-server-ssl-certificate/), and following through the deployment checklist offered
(https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/howto/deployment/checklist/). Beyond that, the commit history was also deleted to hide the previously
exposed django secret key.
